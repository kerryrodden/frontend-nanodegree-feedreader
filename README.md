# Feed Reader testing project

This code is for a project from [Udacity's Front-End Developer nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).

The goal of the project was to write a set of basic tests for a given web-based RSS feed reader application, using [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/).

## How to run

[Click on this link](https://kerryrodden.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader/) and review the Jasmine results at
the bottom of the page.

Or, if you prefer to run locally, you can download or clone this repository, and then open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## Contributing

This was a course project and was put onto Github for grading, so unfortunately I cannot accept contributions. Thank you!
